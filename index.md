## Technical Experience and Projects
Summer of 2021 I got the opportunity to intern on the API Fraud Services team at Disney Streaming! Here I learned how to program functionally with scala (cats, cats-effect), experience with CI/CD (git, mergify, jenkins), a taste of agile development (Scrum), stream processing (with apache flink), became familiar with many AWS products, and experienced new region infrastructure deployments. I contributed code and designed new features which I'm extreamely proud of.

Prior to my internship, I worked on several side projects. Some of which were hackathon submissions that won one or more catagories! You can check them out [here](https://github.com/TacoTuesdayX) on my github. 

One project I would like to highlight though is [EcoSwap](https://github.com/TacoTuesdayX/Ecoswap), largely for the idea, which is similar to an existing app called [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com). Essentially EcoSwap, a chrome extension, will follow you around the internet until your shopping, and reccomend used or artisan alternatives (from etsy, offerUp, ebay, letGo, etc) instead of whatever e-commerce giant you're shopping on. Our users will both save money, and support recyling/reusing clothing (or items) rather than buying newly manufactured.

## Me as a Programmer!
Here are some of the languages I'm familiar, and have experience, with:

I've been programming for 4+ years.
* I'm very fond of functional programming, writing code with type classes in scala boosts my happiness, because I just love fp. I get flashbacks whenever I HAVE to write anything java or c++, the for loop. EW. Don't get me started on java script (unless it's used with Angular or React for a client app UI).

* Python is pretty cool, I like it for AWS lambda and anything that functions as a script.

* I like the parts of programming when your digging through an over-engineered node module (why I hate js) to figure out whether you're the idiot or the open source devs are idiots.
